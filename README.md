# MPFI-Working_with_Tiff_.rois
### Whats this for?
This repo. is a compilation of packages as well as my own personal implementation of some useful tools when working on tiff files and imageJ .roi files.
### What else is included?
An example piece of code using pyqt that given a tiff stack and a roi.zip, will display all rois masked over any given frame of your choice.
